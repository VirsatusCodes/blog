The current state of this application is very bare, I began learning ruby / ruby on rails recently in my spare time between my work for the purposes of a specific job, and i am unsure how long this job will remain up and will be using this in my application, hopefully before this app is looked at it will be in a more put together state. I hope before it is looked at to include at minimum the following.

CURRENT ITERATION: in the middle of implementing user accounts / logins, currently making posts is broken

-User created accounts
-Customizable user accounts
-Filtered searching of blog posts by title
-Filtered searching of comments by commenter
-Styling
